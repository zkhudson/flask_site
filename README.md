**My Personal Website**

I choose to use the Flask web framework for my personal website because I'm familiar with Python. I'm hosting my site in a serverless environment using AWS Lambda.

I assume the following items are already installed in your development environment:
1. Homebrew (Mac users)
2. Python 3.6
3. pipenv
4. Flask
5. awscli

Using Homebrew (on a Mac) makes the installation process more manageable, and keeps the installed system version of Python safe. Also, when working with Flask, it's highly recommended to work within a virtual environment, so you don't affect the OS system files while you are experimenting.

**Note:** Zappa requires that you are in a virtual environment when initializing and uploading your project to AWS.
